# 📊 Restaurant Revenue Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the **annual sales of regional restaurant locations** using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Predict annual restaurant revenue based on provided features  
- Perform thorough data preprocessing and validation  
- Develop and compare multiple regression models  
- Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation  
- Build a stacked ensemble model for enhanced predictions  
- Submit predictions to Kaggle for scoring and evaluation

## 🛠 Key Steps in the Project

- ✅ Loaded and checked data for missing values (none detected)  
- ✅ Preprocessed data for modeling  
- ✅ Built and tuned the following regression models:
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Support Vector Machine Regressor  
- ✅ Performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for each model  
- ✅ Created a stacked ensemble model combining the best-performing models  
- ✅ Conducted additional tuning on the stacked model for further improvements  
- ✅ Selected top 10 important features using `SelectFromModel` with Random Forest  
- ✅ Submitted final predictions for Kaggle evaluation

## 📈 Results

- Achieved competitive Kaggle submission scores by combining individual models and stacking techniques.
- Demonstrated improved predictive performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.
- Identified the top 10 most impactful features contributing to annual restaurant revenue.
- Final stacked model delivered lower RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) compared to individual models.

## 💡 Conclusion

By applying both robust preprocessing techniques and advanced modeling strategies (including stacked ensembles and feature selection), the project demonstrates an effective approach to maximizing predictive performance for restaurant revenue forecasting.
